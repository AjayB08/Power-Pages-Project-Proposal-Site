## Overview

This project illustrates the creation of a Power Pages site using **Microsoft Power Pages**—a low-code platform for building secure, data-driven websites. The tutorial guides you through design choices, in-context editing, navigation setup, and integration with Dataverse, enabling both no-code and pro-code customization. 

---

## Features

- **In-context editing tools**: Use the design studio to easily add text, images, forms, and navigation menus.
- **Template-driven site creation**: Quickly start with default or built-in models (e.g., onboarding, permit requests). 
- **Live previewing**: Preview on desktop or mobile using the built-in QR-code preview feature.
- **Dataverse integration**: Connect site content to backend data storage for lists, forms, and secure content.
